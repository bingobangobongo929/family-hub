feat: Banner display for background events + better AI event naming

Calendar:
- Background events (daycare, school, vacation) now show as subtle
  pill-shaped banners at top of day cells instead of full event slots
- Banners show category emoji + truncated title, clickable
- Regular events display below banners as before

AI Calendar Input:
- Added extensive guidelines for natural event title generation
- Examples of good titles: "Mum's Doctor Appointment" not "Doctor Mum"
- Patterns: "[Member]'s [Event]", "[Event] for [Member]", "[Member] at [Location]"
- Should generate more readable, calendar-friendly event names
